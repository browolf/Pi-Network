'''
This server manages clients looking for pi vanity wallet suffixes

Inputs:
1. suffix required to search - the longer the suffix the exponentially longer the search will likely be

ouputs:
1.a running count of search attempts - [ip of client] Total attempts: <number>
2.Public address and passphrase found. Server exits.

Notes:
1. The server runs on all network interfaces
2. These are the only valid characters: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ234567
3. can control+c to exit the server before the clients are connected or during the process.
