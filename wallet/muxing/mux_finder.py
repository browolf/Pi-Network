'''
Each wallet has approx 4 billion possible muxed addresses.  
This program searches the the entire address space for addresses ending in words using multithreads to speed up the search. 

Input:  Your Pi Wallet public address starting with G

Output: A file containing notable addresses

On a Xeon workstation this script took a week to search the address space.
