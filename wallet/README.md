# Decode.js 

This script using NodeJS will decrypt a Pi Network Passphrase to keys

You need to install these modules first:> 
npm install stellar-sdk @hawkingnetwork/ed25519-hd-key-rn bip39 readline


# new_wallet.py

This script using Python and stellar-sdk module can create a new wallet with keys using the secret key you got from decode

You need a minium amount of coins to perform this operation and you will get an error if you don't have enough in the base wallet. 


# Notes

I don't have a mainnet wallet to ensure it works there.
